# Introduction

This project is an attempt to replicate the game Flappy Bird.

# Task

- Create the bird sprite
    - Add collider
    - Interact with gravity
    - Take the user input and adjust the velocity and acceleration
- Create ground
    - Figure out a way to generate infinite ground
        - This might not be necessary if we fix the bird and move the tubes.
        - However, it's still good to know such techniques.
- Create tubes
- Add user interface.
    - Start the game
    - Restart the game
    - Exist the game
    - keep track of the score.
